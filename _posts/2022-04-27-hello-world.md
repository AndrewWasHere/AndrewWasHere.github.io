Hello, world.

In case you weren't aware, "hello, world" is traditionally the output of the
first program you write when learning a new programming language or platform.
Since I'm just starting to feel my way around GitHub Pages, and blogging with
Jekyll, they are the first words I think to type. So there it is.

To strech a bit, here's an embedded image for this post. I will probably be
doing that more often than not, so I should get comfortable with it.
