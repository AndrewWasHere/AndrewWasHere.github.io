## Highlights

### Video Morse Decoder

In 2018, UCSD unveiled a new project in the 
[Stuart Collection](https://stuartcollection.ucsd.edu/).
It was a tall tower, with a light affixed to the top, blinking out Morse Code. 
Wanting to know what the message was, I recorded 10 minutes of video, and wrote 
some Python code to decode the message. I composed a write-up as a Jupyter 
Notebook in the repo, which GitHub will kindly render for you in source view, 
[here](https://github.com/AndrewWasHere/video-morse-decoder/blob/master/Video%20Morse%20Code.ipynb).

### STEAM Activities

From 2016 through 2019, I designed and presented STEAM activities for elementary 
school students. Many of them got uploaded to GitHub. My favorite of the 
uploaded activities is
[Pattern Recognition and Illusion](https://github.com/AndrewWasHere/steam_illusion).
Of all the activities I developed, it had the strongest engagement from the 
students, teacher, and parent volunteers. It was also the most fun to do.
